# GrowthCore Component Extraction

## Description
This project is a faithful React + Tailwind migration of the GrowthCore SaaS landing page, featuring a complex extracted component: `GrowthMarketingTile`. The `GrowthMarketingTile` is a 600x600 animated data visualization module that demonstrates net retention, user avatars, and growth metrics with entrance animations. It simulates a "production-ready" dashboard element found in modern enterprise SaaS applications.

## Tech Stack
- **React 18+** (via Vite/CRA structure)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling engine)
- **Framer Motion** (Animation library for entrance effects and floating elements)
